*For comprehensive testing details, see the "Testing & Quality Assurance" section under Course 2.*

### Course 3: Software Engineering
**Focus**: Architecture, code quality, testing discipline, documentation, and teamwork
**Implementation**: Covers the full course rubric (Design & Architecture, Code Quality, Testing/Debugging, Documentation, Collaboration/Communication) with an Agile/Iterative-Incremental SDLC.

#### Rubric Alignment
- **Design & Architecture**: Modular layers (`/app/gui`, `/access_control`, `/uploader`, `/storage`), clear session/role patterns, SOLID-aligned dataclasses, and documented design decisions. Patterns such as singleton (SessionManager/FirebaseService), factory (RoleManager), and strategy (cache/upload settings) earn the **exemplary** rating.
- **Code of Implementation**: Clean, typed, reusable components with Firebase-backed persistence, configurable OAuth, and reusable helpers—reviewed in unit tests and integration flows, satisfying the **exemplary** standard.
- **Testing & Debugging**: 100+ pytest cases plus mocks for Firebase/YouTube, integration coverage, manual QA checklist, and logging hooks. Edge cases/refresh tokens are covered, so the project targets **exemplary** for testing.
- **Documentation**: README covers setup, configuration, security, testing, and architecture; inline comments explain non-obvious logic; docs reference SRS and SDLC. This meets the **exemplary** documentation bar.
- **Collaboration & Communication**: Git-based branching, milestone tracking, code reviews, and contributor documentation ensure consistent communication and versioning, aligning with the **exemplary** tier.

## 🔄 SDLC Model
The project follows an **Agile / Iterative-Incremental model**:
- Work is divided into milestones (phases).
- Each milestone delivers a working feature (Setup → GUI → Compilation → Uploader → Distribution).
- Feedback-driven improvement.

### Requirements Engineering
The project is based on our **Software Requirements Specification (SRS) v1.0** which defines:
- **Functional Requirements**: User authentication (OAuth 2.0), video selection/arrangement, FFmpeg-based merging, YouTube upload with metadata, progress tracking, and error handling
- **Non-Functional Requirements**: Performance targets (<5 min for 10 HD clips), usability (3-attempt learning curve), security (encrypted token storage), reliability (auto-resume uploads), and maintainability (modular architecture)
- **System Constraints**: Windows 10+, Python with Flet framework, FFmpeg integration, YouTube Data API v3 compliance

For detailed specifications, see:
- **Initial Planning (Pre-Development)**: [Long-Term SRS (LTSRS)](./docs/Group7_LTSRS.pdf) - October 2025
- **Latest Finalized Requirements**: [Software Requirements Specification (SRS)](./docs/Group7_SRS.pdf) - December 2025

#### Python/Firebase Access Control Integration
This project uses a modular Python/Flet system for secure, role-based user management via Firebase Authentication and Firestore:
- **Email/password authentication** (Firebase)
- **Role assignment**: guest, normal, premium, dev, admin
- **Session management** and custom claims
- **Firestore security rules** for data protection
- **Flet UI screens** for login, registration, and role-based access

**Setup Steps:**
1. Create a Firebase project and enable Authentication (Email/Password) and Firestore.
2. Download your `firebase_config.json` and place it in `src/access_control/config/` (never commit secrets; use `.gitignore`).
3. Install dependencies: `pip install pyrebase4 firebase-admin flet`
4. Copy `src/access_control/security/firestore.rules` to your Firebase project.
5. Integrate with Flet using `src/access_control/gui/example_integration.py` and the modules in `src/access_control/auth/`.

**Usage Example:**
```python
from access_control.auth.firebase_auth import FirebaseAuth
from access_control.auth.user_session import UserSession
from access_control.gui.login_screen import LoginScreen

firebase_auth = FirebaseAuth(config_path='config/firebase_config.json')
login_screen = LoginScreen(firebase_auth)
session = UserSession(firebase_auth)
role = session.get_role()
if role == 'admin':
    # Show admin features
    pass
```

**Security Notes:**
- Never commit secrets; always use `.gitignore` for config files.
- Roles are managed via Firebase custom claims and Firestore documents.
- User sessions are handled securely in Python; tokens are refreshed as needed.

#### Admin Dashboard Security Architecture

The admin dashboard implements a comprehensive multi-layer security model to prevent unauthorized access and abuse:

**Access Control Layers:**
1. **UI Layer**: Permission checks using `session_manager.has_permission(Permission.MANAGE_USERS)`
2. **Backend Layer**: `firebase_service.verify_admin_permission()` queries Firestore to confirm admin role
3. **Firebase Rules Layer** (TODO): Server-side security rules validate `request.auth.token.role == 'admin'`
4. **Audit Layer**: All actions logged with admin identity, timestamp, and affected user

**Security Features Implemented:**
- ✅ Immediate access verification on dashboard initialization
- ✅ Unauthorized access attempts logged and redirected
- ✅ Self-modification prevention (can't change own role/delete own account)
- ✅ Confirmation dialogs for destructive actions (role changes, deletions)
- ✅ Backend methods for user disable/enable/delete with audit trails
- ✅ Search and filter functionality for user management at scale
- ✅ Admin dashboard with role-based dropdown selection
- ✅ Add/Update user form with email and role inputs
- ✅ User table with profile pictures, last login, and status indicators
- ✅ Toggle between admin dashboard and configuration view

**Usage:**
Admin dashboard is automatically available to users with the `admin` role. Access is verified on initialization and before every operation to prevent privilege escalation even if frontend bugs exist.

## 📦 Installation & Setup


### API Credentials (YouTube & Firebase)

You must provide your own Google API OAuth credentials and Firebase Admin SDK key for uploads and user management. **Both files must be placed in the `configs/` folder and should NOT be committed to Git or shared publicly.**

1. Go to [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)
2. Create a new project (or select your existing one)
3. Enable the YouTube Data API v3
4. Go to "APIs & Services" → "Credentials"
5. Create OAuth 2.0 Client ID (Desktop app)
6. Download the `client_secret.json` file
7. Place it in `configs/client_secret.json`
8. In [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/), go to Project Settings → Service Accounts → Generate new private key
9. Download the `firebase-admin-key.json` file
10. Place it in `configs/firebase-admin-key.json`
11. **Do not commit these files to Git!**
12. If you ever accidentally commit them, delete them from Git history and regenerate credentials in Google Cloud Console and Firebase Console.

## 📦 Build the App

### Windows

*If errors occur:*

Remember to always delete the build folder when rebuilding the app and run your terminal as an administrator.

Also close file managers or any applications that may be accessing the app directory.

Try restarting your device and disabling your antivirus as a last resort.

(We experienced it the hard way)

```bash
flet build windows -v
```
